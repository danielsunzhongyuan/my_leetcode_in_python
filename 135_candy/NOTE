"""
There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?
"""

1. Since the question doesn't define the behavior that whether children should get the same candies if their rating equals with their neighbors, there would be different results for different behaviors.

For example,
the rating of children is:
[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 10, 10, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1]

then their candies would be:
[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 10, 10, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1]
or
[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1]


2. It doesn't matter to scan the ratings from left to right firstly or from right to left firstly.
