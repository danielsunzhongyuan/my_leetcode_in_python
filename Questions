3. longest-substring-without-repeating-characters
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

Solution one uses recursive function, but will get stack overflow. And it can not handle an array even with only 23 integers.

Solution two transfers recursive function to a loop but with the same method. Then it can solve the 23 intergers array, but fail when the array has 20000+ integers (all are one).

Solution three changes the search direction from left2right to right2left, but makes little difference.
Solution one has O(n!) time complexity and Solution two & three have O(n^2) time efficiency, therefore I try Solution four which has O(n) time efficiency.

At the first beginning, Solution four also failed because I used the following loop:
```for i in range(lastIndex-1, -1, -1):
        ...
```
it failed because "range" will create a space to store a huge number of integers.

xrange will only create a space for one integer.

174. dungeon-game
The demons had captured the princess (P) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (K) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (negative integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (0's) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (positive integers).

In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.


Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.

For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.

-2 (K)    -3    3
-5    -10    1
10    30    -5 (P)

Notes:

The knight's health has no upper bound.
Any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.

Given s = "leetcode", return "leotcede". 


350. intersection-of-two-arrays-ii
Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

Example:
Given nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2], return [2, 2].

Note:

    Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
    The result can be in any order.


389. find-the-difference
Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.
String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"
Output:
e
Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.


401. binary-watch
A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the hours (0-11), and the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the minutes (0-59).
Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.

For example, the above binary watch reads "3:25".
Given a non-negative integer n which represents the number of LEDs that are currently on, return all possible times the watch could represent.

Example:
Input: n = 1
Return: ["1:00", "2:00", "4:00", "8:00", "0:01", "0:02", "0:04", "0:08", "0:16", "0:32"]
Note:
The order of output does not matter.
The hour must not contain a leading zero, for example "01:00" is not valid, it should be "1:00".
The minute must be consist of two digits and may contain a leading zero, for example "10:2" is not valid, it should be "10:02".


434. number-of-segments-in-a-string
Count the number of segments in a string, where a segment is defined to be a contiguous sequence of non-space characters.

Please note that the string does not contain any non-printable characters.

Example:

Input: "Hello, my name is John"
Output: 5


441. arrangin-coins
You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.


451. sort-characters-by-frequency
Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

Example 1:
Input:
"tree"
Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:
Input:
"cccaaa"
Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
Example 3:
Input:
"Aabb"
Output:
"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.


458. poor-pigs
There are 1000 buckets, one and only one of them contains poison, the rest are filled with water. They all look the same. If a pig drinks that poison it will die within 15 minutes. What is the minimum amount of pigs you need to figure out which bucket contains the poison within one hour.

Answer this question, and write an algorithm for the follow-up general case.


479. largest-palindrome-product
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two n-digit numbers.
Since the result could be very large, you should return the largest palindrome mod 1337.

Example:
Input: 2
Output: 987

Explanation: 99 x 91 = 9009, 9009 % 1337 = 987


483. smallest-good-base
For an integer n, we call k>=2 a good base of n, if all digits of n base k are 1.

Now given a string representing n, you should return the smallest good base of n in string format. 

Example 1:
Input: "13"
Output: "3"
Explanation: 13 base 3 is 111.
Example 2:
Input: "4681"
Output: "8"
Explanation: 4681 base 8 is 11111.
Example 3:
Input: "1000000000000000000"
Output: "999999999999999999"
Explanation: 1000000000000000000 base 999999999999999999 is 11.
Note:
The range of n is [3, 10^18].
The string representing n is always valid and will not have leading zeros.


492. construct-the-rectangle
For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web page’s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.

2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.

3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.
Example:
Input: 4
Output: [2, 2]
Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. 
But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.
Note:
The given area won't exceed 10,000,000 and is a positive integer
The web page's width and length you designed must be positive integers.


500. keyboard-row
Given a List of words, return the words that can be typed using letters of alphabet on only one row's of American keyboard like the image below.
Example:
Input: ["Hello", "Alaska", "Dad", "Peace"]
Output: ["Alaska", "Dad"]
Note:
You may use one character in the keyboard more than once.
You may assume the input string will only contain letters of alphabet.
