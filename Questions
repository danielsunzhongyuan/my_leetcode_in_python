16. 3sum-closest
"""
Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

    For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.

    The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

42. trapping-rain-water
"""
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

For example, 
Given [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1], return 6.

50. powx-n
Implement pow(x, n)

56. merge-intervals
"""
Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

For example,
Given [1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18],
return [1,6],[8,10],[15,18].
"""
Using insert function(Q57) to insert the each interval into another list makes the efficiency quite low.
TODO: improve the efficiency.


57. insert-interval
"""
Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).

You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.

Example 1:
Given intervals [1,3],[6,9], insert and merge [2,5] in as [1,5],[6,9].

Example 2:
Given [1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16], insert and merge [4,9] in as [1,2],[3,10],[12,16].

This is because the new interval [4,9] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].

Solution2 is much simplied, however the runtime is larger than that of Solution, a little weird.


69. sqrtx
Implement int sqrt(int x).

135. candy
"""
"""
There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?
"""
1. Since the question doesn't define the behavior that whether children should get the same candies if their rating equals with their neighbors, there would be different results for different behaviors.

For example,
the rating of children is:
[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 10, 10, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1]

then their candies would be:
[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 10, 10, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1]
or
[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1]


2. It doesn't matter to scan the ratings from left to right firstly or from right to left firstly.


144. binary-tree-preorder-traversal
"""
Given a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example:
Given binary tree {1,#,2,3}, return [1, 2, 3]

Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

169. majority-element

Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.
You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

233. number-of-digit-one

Given an integer n, count the total number of digit 1 appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

For example:
Given n = 13,
Return 6, because digit 1 occurred in the following numbers: 1, 10, 11, 12, 13.
"""
Suppose the number is ABCDE, considering the following situations:
a. if A = 1, then result += BCDE + 1
b. if A > 1, then result += 9999 + 1 (i.e., 10**4)
c. from B to E, take C as an example:
    if C > 1, then result += AB99 + 1
    if C = 1, then result += ABDE + 1
    if C = 0, then result += (AB-1)DE + 1


235. lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

274. h-index
"""
Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N − h papers have no more than h citations each."

For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

278. first-bad-version
"""
You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

292. nim-game
"""
You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones.

Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.

For example, if there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game: no matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be removed by your friend.

326. power-of-three
Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of three.


338. counting-bits

Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

For num = 5 you should return [0,1,1,2,1,2].

Follow up:

It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
Space complexity should be O(n).
Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.
