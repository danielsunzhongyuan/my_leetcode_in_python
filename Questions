42. trapping-rain-water
"""
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

For example, 
Given [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1], return 6.

50. powx-n
Implement pow(x, n)
n maybe a negtive number


69. sqrtx
Implement int sqrt(int x).
Compute and return the square root of x.


135. candy
"""
"""
There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?
"""
1. Since the question doesn't define the behavior that whether children should get the same candies if their rating equals with their neighbors, there would be different results for different behaviors.

For example,
the rating of children is:
[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 10, 10, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1]

then their candies would be:
[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 10, 10, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1]
or
[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1]


2. It doesn't matter to scan the ratings from left to right firstly or from right to left firstly.


144. binary-tree-preorder-traversal
"""
Given a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example:
Given binary tree {1,#,2,3}, return [1, 2, 3]

Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

169. majority-element
"""
Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.
You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

220. contains-duplicate-iii
"""
Given an array of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array

The judge seems to have some problems.


233. number-of-digit-one
"""
Given an integer n, count the total number of digit 1 appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

For example:
Given n = 13,
Return 6, because digit 1 occurred in the following numbers: 1, 10, 11, 12, 13.
"""
Suppose the number is ABCDE, considering the following situations:
a. if A = 1, then result += BCDE + 1
b. if A > 1, then result += 9999 + 1 (i.e., 10**4)
c. from B to E, take C as an example:
    if C > 1, then result += AB99 + 1
    if C = 1, then result += ABDE + 1
    if C = 0, then result += (AB-1)DE + 1


274. h-index
"""
Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N − h papers have no more than h citations each."

For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
"""


275. h-index-ii
"""
Follow up for H-Index: What if the citations array is sorted in ascending order? Could you optimize your algorithm?
"""
Solution uses normal search while Solution2 uses binary search.


278. first-bad-version
"""
You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

292. nim-game
"""
You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones.

Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.

For example, if there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game: no matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be removed by your friend.
"""


326. power-of-three
Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of three.


338. counting-bits
"""
Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

Example:
For num = 5 you should return [0,1,1,2,1,2].

Follow up:

It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
Space complexity should be O(n).
Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.
