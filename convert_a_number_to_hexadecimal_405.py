"""
Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, twoâ€™s complement method is used.

Note:

All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0'; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats the number to hex directly.
Example 1:

Input:
26

Output:
"1a"
Example 2:

Input:
-1

Output:
"ffffffff"
