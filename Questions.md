1. Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1]


2. add-two-numbers
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example

Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.


3. longest-substring-without-repeating-characters
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Examples:

Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.


5. longest-palindromic-substring
Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:

Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"


7. reverse-integer
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Example 1:

Input: 123
Output:  321
Example 2:

Input: -123
Output: -321
Example 3:

Input: 120
Output: 21
Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only hold integers within the 32-bit signed integer range. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.


11. container-with-most-water
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0).

"""


19. remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list
Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

Example:

Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
Note:

Given n will always be valid.


20. valid-parentheses
"""
Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

26. remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array
Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.


27. remove-element
Given an array and a value, remove all instances of that value in place and return the new length.
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.
The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
Example:
Given input array nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.


38. count-and-say
The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.
Given an integer n, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

Example 1:

Input: 1
Output: "1"
Example 2:

Input: 4
Output: "1211"

48. rotate-image
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

Note:
You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Example 1:

Given input matrix = 
[
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9]

"""
Solution one uses recursive function, but will get stack overflow. And it can not handle an array even with only 23 integers.

Solution two transfers recursive function to a loop but with the same method. Then it can solve the 23 intergers array, but fail when the array has 20000+ integers (all are one).

Solution three changes the search direction from left2right to right2left, but makes little difference.
Solution one has O(n!) time complexity and Solution two & three have O(n^2) time efficiency, therefore I try Solution four which has O(n) time efficiency.

At the first beginning, Solution four also failed because I used the following loop:
```for i in range(lastIndex-1, -1, -1):
        ...
```
it failed because "range" will create a space to store a huge number of integers.
Then I try to use "xrange" instead of "range", it succeeds.
xrange will only create a space for one integer.

Solution5 is simplified from Solution four, after reading the article.

Using insert function(Q57) to insert the each interval into another list makes the efficiency quite low.
TODO: improve the efficiency.


57. insert-interval
"""
Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).

You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.

Example 1:
Given intervals [1,3],[6,9], insert and merge [2,5] in as [1,5],[6,9].

Example 2:
Given [1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16], insert and merge [4,9] in as [1,2],[3,10],[12,16].

This is because the new interval [4,9] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].

121. best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
Example 2:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.


122. best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.

Example 2:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
Example 3:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]

Example 1:

Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.

Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.

push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
top() -- Get the top element.
getMin() -- Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.
Example:
MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin();   --> Returns -3.
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();      --> Returns 0.
minStack.getMin();   --> Returns -2.


160. intersection-of-two-linked-lists
Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.


For example, the following two linked lists:

A:          a1 → a2
                   ↘
                     c1 → c2 → c3
                   ↗            
B:     b1 → b2 → b3
begin to intersect at node c1.


Notes:

If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.

Calling next() will return the next smallest number in the BST.

Note: next() and hasNext() should run in average O(1) time and uses O(h) memory, where h is the height of the tree.


174. dungeon-game
The demons had captured the princess (P) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (K) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (negative integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (0's) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (positive integers).

In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.


Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.

For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.

-2 (K)    -3    3
-5    -10    1
10    30    -5 (P)

Notes:

The knight's health has no upper bound.
Any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.

"tree"
Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:
Input:
"cccaaa"
Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
Example 3:
Input:
"Aabb"
Output:
"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.


458. poor-pigs
There are 1000 buckets, one and only one of them contains poison, the rest are filled with water. They all look the same. If a pig drinks that poison it will die within 15 minutes. What is the minimum amount of pigs you need to figure out which bucket contains the poison within one hour.

Answer this question, and write an algorithm for the follow-up general case.


479. largest-palindrome-product
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two n-digit numbers.
Since the result could be very large, you should return the largest palindrome mod 1337.

Example:
Input: 2
Output: 987

Explanation: 99 x 91 = 9009, 9009 % 1337 = 987


483. smallest-good-base
For an integer n, we call k>=2 a good base of n, if all digits of n base k are 1.

Now given a string representing n, you should return the smallest good base of n in string format. 

Example 1:
Input: "13"
Output: "3"
Explanation: 13 base 3 is 111.
Example 2:
Input: "4681"
Output: "8"
Explanation: 4681 base 8 is 11111.
Example 3:
Input: "1000000000000000000"
Output: "999999999999999999"
Explanation: 1000000000000000000 base 999999999999999999 is 11.
Note:
The range of n is [3, 10^18].
The string representing n is always valid and will not have leading zeros.


492. construct-the-rectangle
For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web page’s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.

2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.

3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.
Example:
Input: 4
Output: [2, 2]
Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. 
But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.
Note:
The given area won't exceed 10,000,000 and is a positive integer
The web page's width and length you designed must be positive integers.


500. keyboard-row
Given a List of words, return the words that can be typed using letters of alphabet on only one row's of American keyboard like the image below.
Example:
Input: ["Hello", "Alaska", "Dad", "Peace"]
Output: ["Alaska", "Dad"]
Note:
You may use one character in the keyboard more than once.
You may assume the input string will only contain letters of alphabet.


501. find-mode-in-binary-search-tree
Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.


559. maximum-depth-of-n-ary-tree
Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.


589. n-ary-tree-preorder-traversal
Given an n-ary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.
 
Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?


590. n-ary-tree-postorder-traversal
Given an n-ary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.


628. maximum-product-of-three-numbers
Given an integer array, find three numbers whose product is maximum and output the maximum product.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Example 2:
Input: [1,2,3,4]
Output: 24
Note:
The length of the given array will be in range [3,104] and all elements are in the range [-1000, 1000].
Multiplication of any three numbers in the input won't exceed the range of 32-bit signed integer.


623. add-one-row-to-tree
Given the root of a binary tree, then value v and depth d, you need to add a row of nodes with value v at the given depth d. The root node is at depth 1.

The adding rule is: given a positive integer depth d, for each NOT null tree nodes N in depth d-1, create two tree nodes with value v as N's left subtree root and right subtree root. And N's original left subtree should be the left subtree of the new left subtree root, its original right subtree should be the right subtree of the new right subtree root. If depth d is 1 that means there is no depth d-1 at all, then create a tree node with value v as the new root of the whole original tree, and the original tree is the new root's left subtree.



671. second-minimum-node-in-a-binary-tree
Given a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes with the non-negative value, where each node in this tree has exactly two or zero sub-node. If the node has two sub-nodes, then this node's value is the smaller value among its two sub-nodes.

Given such a binary tree, you need to output the second minimum value in the set made of all the nodes' value in the whole tree.

If no such second minimum value exists, output -1 instead.

Example 1:
Input: 
    2
   / \
  2   5
     / \
    5   7

Output: 5
Explanation: The smallest value is 2, the second smallest value is 5.
Example 2:
Input: 
    2
   / \
  2   2

Output: -1
Explanation: The smallest value is 2, but there isn't any second smallest value.


680. valid-palindrome-ii
Given a non-empty string s, you may delete at most one character. Judge whether you can make it a palindrome.

Example 1:
Input: "aba"
Output: True
Example 2:
Input: "abca"
Output: True
Explanation: You could delete the character 'c'.


700. search-in-a-binary-search-tree
Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value. You need to find the node in the BST that the node's value equals the given value. Return the subtree rooted with that node. If such node doesn't exist, you should return NULL.

For example, 

Given the tree:
        4
       / \
      2   7
     / \
    1   3

And the value to search: 2
You should return this subtree:

      2     
     / \   
    1   3
In the example above, if we want to search the value 5, since there is no node with value 5, we should return NULL.

Note that an empty tree is represented by NULL, therefore you would see the expected output (serialized tree format) as [], not null.


701. insert-into-a-binary-search-tree
Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value to be inserted into the tree, insert the value into the BST. Return the root node of the BST after the insertion. It is guaranteed that the new value does not exist in the original BST.

Note that there may exist multiple valid ways for the insertion, as long as the tree remains a BST after insertion. You can return any of them.

For example, 

Given the tree:
        4
       / \
      2   7
     / \
    1   3
And the value to insert: 5
You can return this binary search tree:

         4
       /   \
      2     7
     / \   /
    1   3 5
This tree is also valid:

         5
       /   \
      2     7
     / \   
    1   3
         \
          4


707. design-linked-list
Design your implementation of the linked list. You can choose to use the singly linked list or the doubly linked list. A node in a singly linked list should have two attributes: val and next. val is the value of the current node, and next is a pointer/reference to the next node. If you want to use the doubly linked list, you will need one more attribute prev to indicate the previous node in the linked list. Assume all nodes in the linked list are 0-indexed.

Implement these functions in your linked list class:

get(index) : Get the value of the index-th node in the linked list. If the index is invalid, return -1.
addAtHead(val) : Add a node of value val before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked list.
addAtTail(val) : Append a node of value val to the last element of the linked list.
addAtIndex(index, val) : Add a node of value val before the index-th node in the linked list. If index equals to the length of linked list, the node will be appended to the end of linked list. If index is greater than the length, the node will not be inserted.
deleteAtIndex(index) : Delete the index-th node in the linked list, if the index is valid.


718. maximum-length-of-repeated-subarray
Given two integer arrays A and B, return the maximum length of an subarray that appears in both arrays.

Example 1:
Input:
A: [1,2,3,2,1]
B: [3,2,1,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The repeated subarray with maximum length is [3, 2, 1].
Note:
	1 <= len(A), len(B) <= 1000
	0 <= A[i], B[i] < 100


744. find-smallest-letter-greater-than-target
Given a list of sorted characters letters containing only lowercase letters, and given a target letter target, find the smallest element in the list that is larger than the given target.

Letters also wrap around. For example, if the target is target = 'z' and letters = ['a', 'b'], the answer is 'a'.


747. largest-number-at-least-twice-of-others
In a given integer array nums, there is always exactly one largest element.
Find whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number in the array.
If it is, return the index of the largest element, otherwise return -1.
```
Input: nums = [3, 6, 1, 0]
Output: 1

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: -1
```


779. k-th-symbol-in-grammar
On the first row, we write a 0. Now in every subsequent row, we look at the previous row and replace each occurrence of 0 with 01, and each occurrence of 1 with 10.

Given row N and index K, return the K-th indexed symbol in row N. (The values of K are 1-indexed.) (1 indexed).

Examples:
Input: N = 1, K = 1
Output: 0

Input: N = 2, K = 1
Output: 0

Input: N = 2, K = 2
Output: 1

Input: N = 4, K = 5
Output: 1

Explanation:
row 1: 0
row 2: 01
row 3: 0110
row 4: 01101001
Note:

N will be an integer in the range [1, 30].
K will be an integer in the range [1, 2^(N-1)].


844. backspace-string-compare
Given two strings S and T, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. # means a backspace character.

Example 1:

Input: S = "ab#c", T = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "ac".
Example 2:

Input: S = "ab##", T = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "".
Example 3:

Input: S = "a##c", T = "#a#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "c".
Example 4:

Input: S = "a#c", T = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: S becomes "c" while T becomes "b".
Note:

1 <= S.length <= 200
1 <= T.length <= 200
S and T only contain lowercase letters and '#' characters.
Follow up:

Can you solve it in O(N) time and O(1) space?

We are given a binary tree (with root node root), a target node, and an integer value K.

Return a list of the values of all nodes that have a distance K from the target node.  The answer can be returned in any order.


865. smallest-subtree-with-all-the-deepest-nodes
Given a binary tree rooted at root, the depth of each node is the shortest distance to the root.

A node is deepest if it has the largest depth possible among any node in the entire tree.

The subtree of a node is that node, plus the set of all descendants of that node.

Return the node with the largest depth such that it contains all the deepest nodes in its subtree.



866. prime-palindrome
Find the smallest prime palindrome greater than or equal to N.
Recall that a number is prime if it's only divisors are 1 and itself, and it is greater than 1. 
For example, 2,3,5,7,11 and 13 are primes.
